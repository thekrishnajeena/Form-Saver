# 🧠 FormSaver — Never Lose Your Answers Again

> A lightweight browser extension that **auto-saves everything you type in online forms** and lets you restore it anytime.

Built after losing hours of assignment answers due to session timeout and auto-logout. This extension exists so that **never happens again.**

## 🚀 What It Does

✅ Auto-saves text entered in:
- Assignment portals  
- Google Forms  
- Online exams  
- Any text input / textarea  

✅ Works even if:
- You get logged out  
- Token expires  
- Tab crashes  
- Browser restarts  

✅ One-click restore  
✅ 100% local — no data leaves your system  
✅ No tracking, no cloud, no nonsense

## 🛠 How It Works (Simple)

- As you type → your input auto-saves locally  
- If the page reloads or logs you out → click **Restore**  
- Your previous text instantly reappears  

No login required. No background syncing. Just protection from data loss.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I was filling long assignment answers on a portal.
Session expired.
Auto-logout.
Everything lost.

I rebuilt every answer manually.

Never again.

So I built **FormSaver**.

- Nothing is uploaded  
- Nothing is tracked  
- No ads  
- No analytics  

This is a **tool**, not a data machine.
